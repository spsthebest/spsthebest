## Hey! I'm Shaurya, 
I’m an undergraduate student specializing in Computer Science at the University of Washington, Seattle, with a keen interest in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), Artificial Intelligence, and Biological Computing. My journey revolves around exploring the intersection of technology and biology to address real-world challenges.

As a passionate researcher, my focus lies in integrating BCIs, optogenetics, and AI to create transformative medical solutions. My current goal is to develop a system that cures post-stroke paralysis without the need for traditional therapy, pushing the boundaries of medical science and innovation.

Beyond academics, I am an aspiring entrepreneur, spearheading the development of a safety-focused startup leveraging Maps and technology. I also delve into DNA computing, exploring its potential to solve computational challenges by harnessing the power of nature.

I am deeply committed to education and social impact. I’ve founded educational NGOs to teach computer science to over 300 underprivileged children in Delhi, empowering the next generation with skills and opportunities. Additionally, my passion for sustainability drives me to launch a podcast dedicated to inspiring actionable environmental change.

I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals who share a passion for pushing boundaries and creating a better world. Feel free to reach out to me, and I would love to chat 👋!
