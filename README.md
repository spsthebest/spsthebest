## Hey! I'm Shaurya,

I'm really interested in everything AI, BCIs, Blockchain and Biological Computing. I am on an exhilarating journey to revolutionize the field of medical science and technology.

My ultimate goal is to develop a groundbreaking solution that will help cure post-brain stroke paralysis without the need for therapy. By pushing the boundaries of innovation, I aim to improve the lives of countless individuals and make a lasting impact on the world.

🌍 Empowering Education:
I firmly believe in the power of education to transform lives. As a devoted advocate, I have actively contributed to the community by founding educational NGOs. Through these initiatives, I have had the privilege of teaching and designing computer science curriculums for over 300 underprivileged children in Delhi. Empowering others with knowledge and skills is a cause close to my heart. I also coded a fun sybersecurity quiz app to educate them about cyber fraud.
